&lt;p&gt;Distributed application managing a Distributed Hash Table with a global table divided into partitions, storing each partition in different servers of the distributed application. Each server manages a partition of the global table, which holds a range of values in hash function space (the size of the range is the same for each node). The servers have information that relates the partition of the data to the IP address of the server that manages the corresponding table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability, consistency and fault tolerance properties are based on Zookeeper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a server is down, a new server is created to replace it and allow the application to continue to function. Updated tables are sent to the new server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An objectively ugly basic GUI.&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://dveni.github.io/project/nia-mondo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nia Mondo was developed as part of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://summerofcode.es/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;, a two-week online program where students with different backgrounds developed four open-source software projects framed in the &lt;strong&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team was formed by five students and a coach, where most of us (including myself) had &lt;strong&gt;no previous videogame development experience&lt;/strong&gt;. However, we developed a demo version using Unity and design software. It was a great experience since I have always wanted to try creating a videogame and, also, I had the opportunity to meet awesome people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2D platformer is a proof of concept of a videogame where &lt;strong&gt;your decisions matter&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve your objective: fight climate change! Depending on your initial choice, it will affect the playability and you will have a different ending. Okay, maybe it won&amp;rsquo;t be in the next Game Awards, but who cares? we created it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wanna try it? You can play directly in your browser in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://osoc-es.github.io/nia-mondo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Official Project Website&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social media data mining for fast-food prevalence characterization</title>
      <link>https://dveni.github.io/project/tfg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was carried out as my Final Year Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An escalating global epidemic of overweight and obesity is taking over many parts of the world. Among several factors that influence this, dietary habits are a key element due to they have a profound impact on human life, health, and well-being. In addition, several chronic diseases have been linked to overweight and obesity, which have been found to be positively associated with eating fast-food. Thus, the study of dietary habits is important for both cultural understandings and for monitoring public health. Traditionally, large-scale dietary studies of food consumption used questionnaires and food diaries to keep track of the daily activities of their participants, which can be intrusive and expensive to conduct. In last years social networks have become a valuable source of information to assess the habits, opinions, and decisions taken by their users, so researches are examining ways to use social data to address health-related issues. Framed in a collaboration project part of the Food4Health European program, our work aims to determine if it is possible to characterize fast-food consumption through the in- formation of the messages posted on Twitter. For this purpose, we have made a classifier using machine learning techniques, available with Scikit-learn Python library, capable of classifying tweets from users referring to fast-food. In addition, we have enriched our system with the analysis of the images attached to tweets using both image classification and object detection models. They are based on convolutional neural networks focused on object recognition, and transfer learning techniques have been used to use pre-trained models in our objective, to recognize food. Also, sentiment and emotion analysis have been performed on tweets in order to assess the sentiments and emotions related to fast-food. This system has been tested in the Spanish case, assessing the fast-food prevalence in the country along with image and sentiment analysis to provide health-related information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crypto mining traffic identification</title>
      <link>https://dveni.github.io/project/crypto-traffic/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 20:19:12 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet trafﬁc classiﬁcation has become more important with the rapid growth of
crypto-currency use and crypto-mining tools, which have lead to the exposure to new threats
to end-users and companies. Most of existing approaches to perform this task use predeﬁned
features extracted by an expert in order to classify network trafﬁc. In contrast, in this study,
we propose a deep learning based approach, framed in a bigger research project named Deep
Augur, which aims to facilitate and speed up the characterisation of network ﬂows by means
of advanced Deep Neural Network techniques.
Our proposed scheme can detect the trafﬁc generated by an open-sourced crypto-miner, xmr-
stak, and a worm used for crypto-jacking, madominer, both of them used to mine Monero. The features that describe the captured
ﬂows are generated with Tstat tool. This features allow our model to detect when a trafﬁc ﬂow
belongs to crypto-mining trafﬁc. The model achieved a recall of nearly 100% and a precision
of about 98%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project consists of the design and implementation of a system that reproduces melodies based on a microcontroller, which in our case is a Raspberry Pi 3. The system must reproduce a melody associated with an RFID card when the card is inserted into the system, stopping the reproduction of the melody when the card is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
