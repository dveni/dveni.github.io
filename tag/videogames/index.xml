      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nia Mondo was developed as part of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://summerofcode.es/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;, a two-week online program where students with different backgrounds developed four open-source software projects framed in the &lt;strong&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team was formed by five students and a coach, where most of us (including myself) had &lt;strong&gt;no previous videogame development experience&lt;/strong&gt;. However, we developed a demo version using Unity and design software. It was a great experience since I have always wanted to try creating a videogame and, also, I had the opportunity to meet awesome people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2D platformer is a proof of concept of a videogame where &lt;strong&gt;your decisions matter&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve your objective: fight climate change! Depending on your initial choice, it will affect the playability and you will have a different ending. Okay, maybe it won&amp;rsquo;t be in the next Game Awards, but who cares? we created it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wanna try it? You can play directly in your browser in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://osoc-es.github.io/nia-mondo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Official Project Website&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
